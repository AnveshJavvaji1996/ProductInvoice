# Spring REST API CRUD Application

This project is a Spring Boot REST API application. It is designed to provide a foundation for building CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

## Project Structure

The application uses a standard Spring Boot structure with the following components:

- **Controller**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate services.
- **Service**: Contains business logic for CRUD operations.
- **Repository**: Manages data access, typically interfacing with a database.

## Technologies Used
Java 11 - Programming language
Spring Boot - Application framework
Spring Data JPA - Data access layer
H2/MySQL/PostgreSQL - Database (choose as per your requirement)

## Requirements

- **Java 11** or higher
- **Spring Boot 2.5+**
- **Maven** (for dependency management)
- **Database**: (Specify database if needed, e.g., H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL)

## API Endpoints
Define your API endpoints based on your controllers. Example:

- GET /api/resources - Retrieves all resources
- POST /api/resources - Creates a new resource
- GET /api/resources/{id} - Retrieves a specific resource by ID
- PUT /api/resources/{id} - Updates a resource by ID
- DELETE /api/resources/{id} - Deletes a resource by ID
